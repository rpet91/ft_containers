# ft_containers #12

My twelfth project of the 42 school Codam. In this project you'll have to recreate some existing Containers like Vector, Stack and Map. You'll also need to reimplement iterators, traits and some other functions.

Run ```make``` to compile or ```make test``` to compile and run the test. In the test my ft_containers will be compared with the real std containers in terms of output and speed. The output of the speedtest will be written in their respective files, ```ft_times.txt``` and ```std_times.txt```. In the files you will see the time it took to run for every part.
